# Email-Validator
An Email Validator checks if an email is correctly formatted, contains "@" and a valid domain, and prevents invalid entries. It verifies syntax, domain existence, and sometimes MX records. This improves data accuracy, reduces errors, and enhances security. Commonly used in signups, logins, and newsletters, it ensures only valid emails are accepted.
